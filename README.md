## Introduction to Dart

Dart is an object-oriented programming language that was developed by Google in 2011. It is a type-safe and garbage-collected language that can be used for web and mobile development. Dart is a compiled language that can be compiled to native code for desktop applications or to JavaScript for web applications.

Dart is designed to be easy to learn and use, even for beginners. It has a syntax that is similar to other programming languages like C, C++, and Java.

## Installing Dart SDK
Before you start learning Dart, you need to install the Dart SDK on your machine. The SDK includes the Dart compiler and other tools that you will need to develop Dart applications.

You can download the Dart SDK from the official website: https://dart.dev/get-dart

## Basic Syntax
In Dart, a program consists of a series of statements that are executed in sequence. A statement is a single instruction that performs a specific task. Dart statements are terminated with a semicolon (;).

Here is an example of a Dart program that prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console:
```bash
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}

```
